                <h2><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Our Story</h2>
                <p>For Dr Padmavati Maharana, yoga is more than just exercise; it's a way of life, guided by her personal mantra: <span class="blue-highlight">“Live yoga, love yoga and laugh yoga.”</span></p>
                <p>Affectionately known as Padma, she brings over <span class="blue-highlight">15 years of teaching experience</span>. Originally from Kanpur Village in Odisha, India, she moved to New Zealand in 2016, where she has since taught yoga in Wellington and Canterbury.</p>
                <p>Now settled in Rangiora, Padma is excited to offer classes at her own studio on Victoria Street, North Canterbury. She finds immense satisfaction in teaching, believing that <span class="blue-highlight">yoga has no age limit</span> and can significantly enhance health, wellbeing, and happiness through its various aspects, including postures, breathing, meditation, and cleansing techniques.</p>
                <p>Padma's personal journey with yoga began over 15 years ago as a means to manage her health. She credits yoga with dramatically reducing her frequent asthma attacks and colds, bringing her <span class="blue-highlight">asthma completely under control</span>.</p>
                <p>Her extensive qualifications include a yoga instructors course, a post-graduate diploma in yoga therapy, and a PhD in Yoga titled <span class="blue-highlight">Effect of Integrated Yoga Module on Leadership Development.</span></p>
                <h2><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to share the transformative power of yoga, helping individuals find balance, strength, and inner peace through a practice that is safe, sustainable, and tailored to their individual needs.</p>
