                <h2><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Our Story</h2>
                <p>For Dr Padmavati Maharana, yoga is not just exercise – it is a way of life. Her personal mantra is “Live yoga, love yoga and laugh yoga”.</p>
                <p>Affectionately known as Padma to her friends and students, the 41 year-old has been teaching yoga for more than 15 years. Originally from the Kanpur Village of Balasore district of Odisha in the Eastern part of India she has been living in New Zealand since 2016 and has taught yoga in Wellington and Canterbury.</p>
                <p>Now that she has made Rangiora home she is excited to be able to offer classes to the people of North Canterbury at her very own studio on Victoria Street, Rangiora.</p>
                <p>“Everything about yoga fascinates me. There are different aspects of yoga including postures, breathing, meditation and cleansing techniques.</p>
                <p>“I love that I am able to offer yoga instruction to people. For me there is not age limit for yoga. Teaching people the skills needed to increase their health, wellbeing and happiness through yoga practices and breathing techniques gives me immense satisfaction.”</p>
                <p>Padma was first introduced to yoga by a friend more than 15 years ago as a way to help control her health and has been hooked ever since.</p>
                <p>“I used to get frequent asthma attacks and was always suffering from a cold. After I started yoga I had less and less asthma attacks and very rarely had a cold. Now my asthma is completely under control which I credit to yoga.”</p>
                <p>Padma has completed a yoga instructors course and also has a post-graduate diploma in yoga therapy, and a PhD in Yoga titled Effect of Integrated Yoga Module on Leadership Development.</p>
                <h2><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to share the transformative power of yoga, helping individuals find balance, strength, and inner peace through a practice that is safe, sustainable, and tailored to their individual needs.</p>
